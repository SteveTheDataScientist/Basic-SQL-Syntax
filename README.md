# Manipulating Data with SQL

A data project demonstrating intermediate understanding of SQL and SQL data manipulation

This project seeks to demonstrate an intermediate understanding of SQL and SQL data manipulation. The project specifically focuses on understanding tables in SQL, the INSERT command, what to do when the INSERT command doesn't work, the UPDATE command, the Batch Load, and DELETE and DROP.

For tables in SQL, this project investigates and analyzes tables to better identify and understand different data types and constraints that affect data manipulation in the table.

The INSERT command section used SQL to insert rows of new data into a relational database table.

This project also demonstrates troubleshooting methods to help me locate and repair errors in SQL code.

The UPDATE Command section of this project demonstrated the ability to write SQL code to modify existing pieces of data within a table row.

The Batch Load section involved the development and running a script that loads a relational table with multiple rows at a time.

Finally, the DELETE and DROP section demonstrates methods of eliminatind data from existing data tables.
